    <span class="name">Meta-transfer learning for factorizing representations and knowledge for AI</span>
      </p>
    <p><b>Abstract</b>: Whereas machine learning theory has focused on generalization to examples from the same distribution as the training data, better understanding of the transfer scenarios where the observed distribution changes often in the lifetime of the learning agent is important, both for robust deployment and to achieve a more powerful form of generalization which humans seem able to enjoy and which seem necessary for learning agents. Whereas most machine learning algorithms and architectures can be traced back to assumptions about the training distributions, we also need to explore assumptions about how the observed distribution changes. We propose that sparsity of change in distribution, when knowledge is represented appropriately, is a good assumption for this purpose, and we claim that if that assumption is verified and knowledge represented appropriately, it leads to fast adaptation to changes in distribution, and thus that the speed of adaptation to changes in distribution can be used as a meta-objective which can drive the discovery of knowledge representation compatible with that assumption. We illustrate these ideas in causal discovery: is some variable a direct cause of another? and how to map raw data to a representation space where different dimensions correspond to causal variables for which a clear causal relationship exists? What generative model of the data can be quickly adapted to interventions in the agent's environment? We propose a large research program in which this non-stationarity assumption and meta-transfer objective is combined with other closely related assumptions about the world embodied in a world model, such as the consciousness prior (the causal graph is captured by a sparse factor graph) and the assumption that the causal variables are often those agents can act upon (the independently controllable factors prior), both of which should be useful for agents which plan, imagine and try to find explanations for what they observe.</p>

    <span class="name">Deep Generative Model for Spatiotemporal Data</span>
      </p>
    <p><b>Abstract</b>:
      Large-scale spatiotemporal data is abundant in many real-world applications, such as intelligent transportation, aerospace control, physical systems, and sports analytics. Spatiotemporal data presents unique challenges to generative modeling, such as spatial proximity, nonlinear dynamics, and multiresolution structures. For example, traffic patterns tend to be spatially coherent; basketball plays have short-term actions and long-term goals. In this talk, I will showcase how to design deep generative models to learn from complex spatial and temporal structures, especially for dealing with non-Euclidean geometry, long-term dependencies, and multiresolution structures. We demonstrate the successful application of these techniques to various domains including transportation and sports analytics.</p>

    <span class="name">Continuous-Output Language Generation</span>
      </p>
    <p><b>Abstract</b>:
      The softmax layer is used as the output layer of nearly all existing models for language generation. However, softmax is the computational bottleneck of these systems: it is the slowest layer to compute, and it has a huge memory footprint; to reduce time- and memory-complexity, many language generation systems limit their output vocabulary to a few tens of thousands of most frequent words, sacrificing the linguistic diversity and completeness of outputs. Finally, generating language using generative adversarial networks (GANs) is a notoriously hard task specifically due to the softmax layer. In this talk I'll introduce continuous-output generationâ€”a general modification to the seq2seq models for generating text sequences which does away with the softmax layer, replacing it by the embedding layer. I will also describe ongoing work which explores alternative losses for continuous-output generation, approaches to efficient decoding, and continuous-output GANs for text.</p>

    <span class="name">Learning about Language with Normalizing Flows</span>
      </p>
    <p><b>Abstract</b>:
      Human language is complex and highly structured, with the unique syntax of each language defining this structure. While analyzing this structure and using it to train better NLP models is of inherent interest to linguists and NLP practitioners, for most languages in the world there is a paucity of labeled data. In this talk, I will discuss unsupervised and semi-supervised methods for learning about this structure and the correspondence between languages, specifically take advantage of a powerful tool called normalizing flows to build generative models over complex underlying structures. First, I will give a brief overview of normalizing flows, using an example from our recent work that uses these techniques to learn bilingual word embeddings. Then, I will demonstrate how these can be applied to un- or semi-supervised learning of linguistic structure with structured priors for part-of-speech tagging or dependency parsing.</p>

    <span class="name">Latent-Space Generative Models</span>
      </p>
    <p><b>Abstract</b>:
      Deep generative models have significantly improved in the past few years, however, there are still many open questions when it comes to modeling high-dimensional data. Generative models need to capture non-linear long-range dependencies on multiple timescales to get globally coherent samples of audio, images, text and video. A lot of progress has been made by simply using larger models and more computation, where architectural novelty could be more efficient. Finally, using generative models in downstream tasks rather than generating samples is still in its infancy. We argue for hierarchical generative models that capture the data distribution in a compressed latent space rather than the pixel space. We show that combining autoregressive modeling with hierarchical discrete latent spaces dramatically improves quality, diversity and long-range consistency in samples. In similar vein we present Contrastive Predictive Coding, which uses a contrastive loss to model abstract latent representations and achieve state of the art results on unsupervised learning benchmarks.</p>
